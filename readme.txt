Sequentially or randomly schedule ALL draft posts for posting.

== Description ==
Ever imported or written a whole bunch of posts in draft status, then realized you needed to post them all over time?

If you've tried to do this manually, you know it takes a LONG time even using the Quick Edit.

Draft Scheduler solves this problem, allowing you to schedule ALL drafts to be posted based on your settings.

Usage:

* Choose from the 3 options
* Sequentially based on your selected interval (hours & minutes)
* Random draft posts at the interval you choose
* Fully random inside a daily time frame with a random number of posts per day within a daily maximum you choose.
* All options also allow you to choose the start date. See Screenshots.
* Click Schedule Drafts and ALL posts withe status DRAFT will be scheduled.

NB: I've said it before - ALL drafts will be scheduled, and there is no undo option.

== Installation ==

1. Upload draft-scheduler folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the Draft Schedule menu option under TOOLS and setup your options.
